# TaggedMobileClient
A mobile version of my first react app. I'm using React Native and Ruby on Rails with a Postgres DB. This version enables real time location sharing, image upload, and an interactive map experience. The server code can be found here: https://github.com/maddieijams/TaggedMobileServer
